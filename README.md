### Hi!
## I'm Zack and I spend my time writing code that only just works. 
---
I've spent a long time exploring bezier curves and metaballs.

At the moment I am interested in web developement in tamdem with threejs.
I want to use it to display procedural generation!

For this I am learning about the wave function collapse but I may have to fall back to coding this in python as my javascript is not quite up to speed yet.

In general I am interested in everything python, machine learning and front-end web developement.
